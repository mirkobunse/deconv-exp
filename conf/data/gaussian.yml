# Secondary attributes x1...x10

# The parameters offset, factor, gamma and sigma are drawn uniformly at random from the
# given ranges. They remain fixed for each of the attributes. Each attribute j of item i
# is computed as follows:
# 
# x_{i, j} = N(offset_j + factor_j * y_i ^ gamma_j, sigma_j)
# 
# where N(m, sigma_j) draws randomly from a normal distribution with mean m.
# 
# This approach follows the description of [ruhe2013data]. Note that the current state of
# implementation of [ruhe2013data] is not strictly following this description.
